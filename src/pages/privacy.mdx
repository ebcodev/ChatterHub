### 1. Information We Collect

- Email address and license information: collected only to deliver receipts/confirmations for your order, issue or verify your license, and respond to support requests.  
- Support communications: if you email us, we receive the information you include in that message.  
- Order/license metadata from processors: Polar (built on Stripe) may share order/license metadata with us. We do not receive your full payment card details.  
- We do not collect: chats, prompts, files, usage analytics tied to personal identifiers, device identifiers, IP addresses, location data, or any other personal data from your device.

### 2. How Your Data Is Stored

- Local-only: All app content (including your chats, prompts, settings, and any API keys you add) is stored on your device.  
- No backend: The app does not send your content to our servers, and we do not have access to it.  
- API keys: Stored locally (e.g., local storage) on your device and never sent to us.  
- Third-party model providers: If you configure an API key, requests go directly from your device to that provider under their terms. We do not proxy or store your keys. Please search for and review the privacy policy of any provider you choose to use. We do not control or guarantee how those providers handle your data.

### 3. Payments and Orders

- Polar/Stripe: Purchases are processed by Polar (which uses Stripe). These processors may collect billing details and other information as needed to complete your purchase. We receive only the information necessary to issue and verify your license (e.g., your email and license/order metadata). We do not store your payment card information.

### 4. Sharing and Transfers

- No selling or advertising use: We do not sell your personal information or use it for targeted advertising.  
- No routine sharing: We do not share your app data. We may share your email/order or license details with Polar/Stripe solely to fulfill and support your purchase and license.  
- No transfers of app content: Because we do not run a backend, your app content is not transferred off your device.

### 5. Data Retention

- Email/license/order records: retained for the lifetime of your license and as required to meet legal, tax, or accounting obligations.  
- App content: remains on your device. We do not provide cloud backup or sync, and we do not have a copy.

### 6. Security

- Local security: Because your data is stored locally, the security of your device (e.g., OS updates, passcodes) is important.  
- Our systems: We do not maintain servers for your app content. We use reasonable safeguards to protect limited order/support/license information we hold (e.g., your email).

### 7. Your Rights

- Access/Deletion: You can request access to or deletion of the email/license/order information we hold by contacting [support@chatterhub.site](mailto:support@chatterhub.site).  
- App content: Stored locally on your device; you can delete it in-app or by removing the app or its local data.  
- Depending on your location, you may have additional privacy rights under local law.

### 8. Children

The app is intended for users 18+. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

### 9. Do Not Track

We use Vercel Analytics. We do not otherwise track users across sites. Browser DNT signals do not change our current practices.

### 10. Changes

We may update this notice to reflect changes to our practices or legal requirements. The "Last updated" date shows the effective date.
